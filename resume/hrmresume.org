    /Aug 2010 - Dec 2011/

+ Investigated the minimization of fault propagation in a hydraulic actuator through real-time adjustment in the commanded flight path.
+ Developed a robust altitude controller for an F-16 fighter aircraft model using $H_\infty$ synthesis.
+ Performed sensitivity analysis of the path adjustment algorithm under modeling error.
+ Demonstrated the improved control strategy using a hydraulic solenoid valve hardware-in-the-loop system prototyped in Simulink and driven by dSPACE software.
